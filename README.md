# waterplant-landing
This is a landing page of a project of Tangible Interaction course in Bachelor in Digital Interaction and Multimedia Techniques at Open University of Catalonia - UOC.

In this repo you can find the files to link the data extracted from the arduino water plant system into a small landing page. This is an example of the result. 

Comments on the ino file are in Spanish. 

The package.json contains the dependencies so we need to run npm install: Serialport and Socket.io.

You will need to change the SerialPort according to the one of your Arduino. 

This project is a custom version of combining this other projects:
